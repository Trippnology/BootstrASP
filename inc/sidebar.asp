<h1>Right menu</h1>
<p>Not everybody likes a menu on the right. Feel free to remove the include if you don't need it.</p>
<p>We might as well use this space to demonstrate the modal which is included in every page.</p>
<a class="btn" data-toggle="modal" href="#globalmodal">Launch Modal</a>
<p>I'll also pad this out with more text and images to get a better idea of the layout.</p>
<p>The image below is being dynamically resized by CSS.</p>
<img class="roundsm" src="img/trippnology-facebook-page-logo.png" width="250" height="250" alt="Trippnology Facebook page logo">
