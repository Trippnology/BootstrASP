<h1>Sidebar</h1>
<p>Need some content in a sidebar? No problem, just call it with:</p>
<p><code>&lt;!-- #include file=&quot;inc/sidebar.asp&quot; --&gt;</code></p>
<p>We might as well use this space to demonstrate the modal which is included in every page.</p>
<p><a class="btn" data-toggle="modal" href="#globalmodal">Launch Modal</a><p>
<p>I'll also pad this out with more text and images to get a better idea of the layout.</p>
<p>The image below is being dynamically resized by CSS.</p>
<img class="roundsm" src="img/trippnology-gwt-logo.png" width="250" height="250" alt="Trippnology - We're good with technology">
