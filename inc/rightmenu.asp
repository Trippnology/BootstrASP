<h1>Right menu</h1>
<p>Not everybody likes a menu on the right. Feel free to remove the include if you don't need it.</p>
<p>We might as well use this space to <a id="fancybox-trigger" href="#global-fancybox">demonstrate the Fancybox overlay</a> which is included in every page.</p>
<p>I'll also pad this out with more text and images to get a better idea of the layout.</p>
<p>The image below is being dynamically resized by CSS.</p>
